# Prenuptial Agreement

The Parties/signatories to this Agreement are advised that signing this document will have legal consequences. Where either Party is unsure or does not understand the legal obligations and responsibilities placed upon them under this Agreement, they are advised to seek legal advice before signing.

## Introduction

This Prenuptial Agreement ("Agreement") is made on [Date] between [Husband's Name] ("the Husband") and [Wife's Name] ("the Wife"), collectively referred to herein as "the Parties," in contemplation of their upcoming marriage.

## Recitals

- **Purpose of the Agreement**:  
The Parties enter into this Agreement to establish their respective rights and obligations regarding property, assets, and support in the event of a dissolution of their marriage. Specifically, this Agreement is executed pursuant to existing family obligations set forth by the Husband's family, wherein family members desiring to retain ownership shares in Wescast Industries Inc. ("Wescast") are mandated to enter into such a marriage contract.  
   
- **Voluntary Execution**:  
The Wife acknowledges that prior to marriage, the Husband explicitly informed her that signing this Agreement was mandatory, without which the marriage would not proceed. The Husband further explicitly informed the Wife that the sole objective of this Agreement is to ensure that shares in Wescast remain exclusively within his family. The Wife, being fully apprised of this motivation, and after considering its implications, has voluntarily agreed to the execution of this Agreement. The Parties affirmatively declare that they are entering this Agreement fully informed and voluntarily, without duress or coercion.  

- **Disclosure**:  
The Parties acknowledge that the Husband has provided limited financial disclosure, explicitly represented in Schedule A as follows:  
   - Husband’s stated net worth at the date of marriage is "$80,000 + LeVan Family Companies interest (the Trust)," the stated $80,000 comprising RRSPs, bank accounts, and an original house deposit.  
   - Ownership of 100 common shares in RyVan Inc. explicitly declared.  
   - The Husband specifically holds 25% common shares in three companies: RyVan Inc., Grannyco Investments Ltd., and RWL Investments Ltd.  
   - The Husband maintains contingent beneficial interest in the LeVan Family Trust ("the Trust"), a trust with significant assets of which he is one of four sole beneficiaries, with this contingent interest having a "very minimal value" at the date of marriage as explicitly indicated by the Husband.  
   - At the time of signing, the Husband has explicitly declared having no debts.  

The Husband explicitly declined to provide detailed disclosure of his full income or exact net worth beyond the above-stated Schedule A, declaring explicitly his desire to prevent the Wife from having details about his total income and complete asset valuation as a means to maintain control over their lifestyle during marriage. The Wife acknowledges and agrees explicitly to proceed without such detailed disclosure, accepting the limitations of the provided financial information.

- **Legal Advice**:  
The Parties confirm they have each received independent legal advice regarding the terms and implications of this Agreement.

- **Children**:  
The Parties acknowledge the existence of two young children resulting from their marriage:  
- Children of both Husband and Wife: [Names of Children]  
The Parties explicitly recognize these children for purposes of clarity in future obligations and agreements.

- **Binding Nature**:  
The Parties explicitly intend this Agreement to be fully binding upon themselves, their heirs, executors, trustees, successors, assigns, and personal representatives.

## Article I - Separate Property

- **Definition**:  
Separate Property explicitly includes all assets listed in Schedule A and specifically encompasses all of the Husband's business interests, including but not limited to:  
   - All shares, dividends, interests or assets associated with Wescast Industries Inc., RyVan Inc., Grannyco Investments Ltd., RWL Investments Ltd., and the LeVan Family Trust, and including any appreciation or income arising therefrom during the marriage.  

- **Ownership**:  
Each Party explicitly retains full ownership and control over their respective Separate Property, including the right to exclusively manage, dispose, or otherwise deal with such property as they see fit without claim by the other.

## Article II - Marital Property

- **Definition**:  
Marital Property explicitly excludes all assets classified as Separate Property and shall refer only to property jointly acquired by the Parties during marriage, excepting those designated explicitly as Separate Property.

- **Division**:  
Marital Property acquired by joint contributions shall, in the event of dissolution of the marriage, be divided between the Parties fairly and equitably, subject explicitly to each Party's contributions towards the acquisition, maintenance, and growth of such property. The Wife explicitly acknowledges relinquishment of any entitlement to claim the increased value of the Husband's Separate Property, including all enumerated business interests, during the marriage.

## Article III - Spousal Support

- **Waiver**:  
The Parties explicitly agree, as per the Husband’s explicit wishes clearly communicated prior to signing this Agreement, that in the event of marriage breakdown, the Husband does not wish to pay spousal support to the Wife.  

- **Exception**:  
Paragraph 8(c) has explicitly been inserted into this Agreement, severely limiting the Wife's right to claim spousal support from the Husband irrespective of changes in circumstances or marital dissolution.

## Article IV - Debts and Liabilities

- **Separate Debts**:  
The Parties expressly confirm the Husband's absence of debt at the time of signing. Each Party shall be solely responsible for debts incurred individually during the marriage without recourse to the other's Separate Property.

- **Joint Debts**:  
Any debts assumed jointly during the term of the marriage shall be the equal responsibility of both Parties in the absence of explicit agreement otherwise.

## Article V - Amendments and Modifications

- **Writing Requirement**:  
Any amendments or modifications to this Agreement must explicitly be in writing and signed by both Parties.

- **Effective Date**:  
Amendments or modifications shall explicitly become effective immediately upon mutual execution by both Parties.

## Article VI - Death or Incapacity

- **Survivorship Rights**:  
In the event of death, no rights shall automatically vest to the surviving Party regarding Separate Property; such Separate Property shall explicitly pass according to testamentary instructions or prevailing estate laws, explicitly excluding any claim by the other Party unless otherwise separately documented.

- **Incapacity**:  
In the event either Party becomes incapacitated, the other Party's rights shall be according to applicable law or separate arrangements apart from this Agreement.
