Initial conditions of the contract (Lease):

- Initial term of 10 years starting in October 1998.
- Rent to be paid as "50% of the gross revenue derived from the operation of said equipment."
- Lessee shall have an option to extend this Lease, upon identical terms and conditions as set forth herein, for two (2) successive periods of seven (7) years each, such options to be considered exercised unless Lessee notifies Lessor to the contrary of at least Six (6) months prior to the end of the original Lease term or the end of the first renewal term thereof.
- The 7-year extensions are considered automatically exercised unless the Tenant notifies the Landlord otherwise at least 6 months before the end of the original lease term or the first renewal term.

Initial conditions of the Addendum, executed at or around the same time as the Lease:

- [Landlord] and [Tenant] agree that for any buildings still owned by the [Landlord] at the end of the initial 10 year term [Tenant] shall then be entitled to extend the initial 10 year term for an additional 10 years in exchange for a payment of the then current market rate for similar laundry room leases.
- The 10-year extension is "in exchange for a payment of the then current market rate for similar laundry room leases."
- The Addendum was drafted on Tenant stationery suggesting the Tenant, not the Landlord, was the drafter.

General rules governing leases:

-The general rule governing notice of lease renewal is that the giving of timely notice, in accordance with the provisions of the lease, is a condition precedent to the lessee's right to renew. The rule is grounded on the principle that time is of the essence in an option contract and that a notice requirement is strictly construed.
- Florida law requires that a contract be interpreted against the drafter when the contract contains ambiguous terms.
