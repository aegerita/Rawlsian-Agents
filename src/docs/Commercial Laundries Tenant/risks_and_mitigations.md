Title: Ambiguity in Rent Calculation
Impact: Rent is defined as 50% of gross revenue, which can lead to disputes regarding calculation methods, and potential non-payment.
Scenario: If the Tenant misreports revenue or there is a significant downturn in business, the Landlord may struggle to collect expected rent, affecting cash flow.
Mitigation: Clarify the method for calculating gross revenue and require detailed financial disclosures from the Tenant regularly.

Arbitrator's POV:
 Analysis: The current commercial lease agreement raises risks primarily related to the ambiguous definition of the rent calculation, defined as 50% of gross revenues derived from the Tenant's operations. This phrasing might lead to varying interpretations between the Landlord and Tenant, particularly regarding what constitutes gross revenue. Financial imbalances can arise from a Tenant with limited financial reporting knowledge or even a Landlord lacking in auditing experience, potentially skewing the perception of rental obligations. In cases of revenue misrepresentation, the Tenant's financial vulnerability can affect their capability to fulfill rent obligations, especially if unexpected downturns occur, leading to a lengthy dispute process, disrupted relationships, or significant cash flow issues for the Landlord. Fairness and ethical integrity are critical in contract negotiations, especially under changing economic conditions that can impact revenue significantly; hence, clarity in contractual terms is essential for ongoing conscionability.
Edit: Amend Section 5.1 to specify that "The Tenant shall calculate and provide detailed financial statements evidencing gross revenue on a quarterly basis to ensure transparency in the calculation of Rent due to the Landlord, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."


Title: Lengthy Lease Term
Impact: A 10-year term with extensions can lock the Landlord into a disadvantageous deal if market conditions change.
Scenario: If real estate prices rise significantly, the Tenant may benefit under the fixed lease terms while the Landlord misses out on potential increases in rental income.
Mitigation: Implement a clause that allows for rent adjustments based on market conditions at set intervals throughout the lease term.

Arbitrator's POV:
 Analysis: The lengthy lease term coupled with fixed rental terms presents financial risks to the Landlord, potentially trapping them in a less favorable agreement should market rental prices increase over the lease duration. This situation creates a power imbalance that could become unconscionable, as it benefits the Tenant disproportionately without a fair mechanism allowing the Landlord to adapt to changing economic conditions. Furthermore, it emphasizes disparities in financial knowledge where the Tenant may take advantage of stable payments while the Landlord faces rising costs and lost opportunities, questioning the ethical consciousness of the agreement in the long term. The impact of this risk may only worsen with time and changing market dynamics, risking a deterioration of trust between parties if the Landlord feels exploited. 

Considering the adaptability of the agreement to changing market conditions is essential for maintaining fairness. Incorporating specific intervals for market rent assessments could provide a balance, ensuring both parties benefit equitably over time and protecting against unforeseen economic shifts. Additionally, it sets an expectation for open communication and collaboration on financial matters, promoting ethical negotiations.
Edit: Add a clause stating: "Rent shall be reviewed and adjusted every three years based on the prevailing market rate for similar properties in the area, ensuring both parties maintain equitable terms as market conditions evolve."


Title: Tenant's Indemnity Clause
Impact: Landlord's indemnity clause may disproportionately protect the Landlord while exposing the Tenant's liabilities without adequate balancing.
Scenario: If the Tenant incurs liability due to an unforeseen circumstance, they may struggle financially, thereby impacting their ability to pay rent.
Mitigation: Modify the indemnity clause to limit Tenant's liability to instances of negligence to ensure it is not overly burdensome.

Arbitrator's POV:
 Analysis: The indemnity clause as currently stated is heavily tilted in favor of the Landlord, exposing the Tenant to significant liabilities without sufficient protection. This disproportionate burden can create a power imbalance that results in unfairness and potential unconscionability of the agreement over time, especially if unforeseen circumstances arise that lead to liability for which the Tenant is responsible. Additionally, the lack of reasonable limits on liability can discourage potential Tenants from entering into the lease, which is not favorable for the long-term viability of the agreement. If the Tenant struggles financially due to unpredicted liabilities incurred, such as natural disasters or legal challenges related to operations, their capacity to pay rent may be compromised, resulting in a default situation. The risk is amplified if the Tenant has limited legal expertise or resources to negotiate better terms or access legal counsel, hence creating an ethical concern regarding fairness and the overall integrity of the commercial lease process. From the Landlord's perspective, the current clause might provide a false sense of financial security, reinforcing the need for a more balanced approach that considers both parties' vulnerabilities as well as potential future situations that could arise throughout the lease term.
Edit: Amend Section 6.9 Indemnification to read: "The Tenant will indemnify the Landlord from and against all actions, claims, lawsuits, damages, losses, costs, and expenses that the Landlord may sustain or incur by reason of the acts or omissions of the Tenant or any persons for whom the Tenant is responsible, except in cases where such claims arise solely from the negligence or willful misconduct of the Landlord, thus ensuring that Tenant's exposure to liability is limited and fair."


Title: Repair and Maintenance Responsibilities
Impact: Tenant is fully responsible for repair and maintenance, which could become a financial burden and lead to disputes.
Scenario: If major repairs are required, the Tenant might delay action due to financial strain, resulting in property deterioration.
Mitigation: Establish a cap on the Tenant’s repair responsibilities, making the Landlord responsible for major structural repairs to maintain property integrity.

Arbitrator's POV:
 Analysis: The current commercial lease agreement places full responsibility for repair and maintenance on the Tenant, which might lead to an unconscionable situation over time due to potential financial burdens that could arise from major repairs. A financial disparity between the Landlord and Tenant could create an imbalance if the Tenant lacks resources to handle unexpected costs. For example, if a major structural failure occurs, the Tenant may be forced to delay necessary repairs, leading to subsequent damages and disputes, further exacerbating financial strain and potentially risking the viability of their business.

From a legal and financial perspective, the agreement appears to favor the Landlord since the Tenant bears all costs associated with repairs, regardless of their nature. This structure could be seen as ethically questionable and create a power imbalance, wherein a financially struggling Tenant remains vulnerable to further risk and liability. Moreover, the Tenant's lack of access to legal counsel or resources to negotiate additional terms may leave them more exposed. 

Additionally, ambiguity surrounding the definition of ‘major repairs’ or what constitutes normal versus extraordinary maintenance could lead to disputes later on. The lack of clear delineation of repair responsibilities could challenge the agreement's fairness and conscionability.  

Adaptive solutions should be implemented within the lease to ensure that evolving circumstances—such as unexpected financial shifts from the Tenant’s side, changing regulatory environments, or natural disasters—are accounted for to promote fairness. Currently, the fields regarding repair responsibilities do not account for situations where a major business disruption may occur due to actionable negligence from the Tenant or Landlord.

By including safeguards such as cost thresholds for Tenant repair responsibilities, this agreement could maintain equitable balance, promote ethical negotiation and responsiveness, and ensure continued conscionability over the Lease's duration.
Edit: Add a clause stating: "The Landlord shall be responsible for all major structural repairs exceeding [insert specific dollar amount] per incident, while the Tenant is responsible for routine maintenance and minor repairs, ensuring a cap on the Tenant’s financial burden.'


Title: Termination Provision Favoring Tenant
Impact: The Tenant’s ability to terminate with only a year’s notice can leave the Landlord abruptly without income, risking financial loss.
Scenario: If the Tenant's business faces financial difficulties or shifts strategy, they might terminate early, leaving the Landlord to re-lease the property in a difficult market.
Mitigation: Require a longer notice period or some form of lease termination penalty to protect the Landlord's financial interests.

Arbitrator's POV:
 Analysis: The risk posed by the Tenant's ability to terminate the lease with only a year’s notice could create a significant financial vulnerability for the Landlord. Given the volatility of the commercial real estate market and the potential for sudden changes in a Tenant's business strategy or solvency, the current provision could have severe implications for the Landlord. Without adequate protections, the Landlord may find it challenging to re-lease the property quickly or recover lost revenues, raising concerns about the lease's conscionability. 

From a legal and financial perspective, if the Tenant is in a stronger financial position or has superior legal resources compared to the Landlord, they may exploit this advantage to exit the lease with minimal repercussions. 

Additionally, if economic conditions deteriorate or if there are natural events affecting the area, this risk may exacerbate, leading to an inability for the Landlord to find a suitable replacement Tenant in a timely manner. This creates a power imbalance that compromises ethical considerations and fairness over the term of the lease. 

To ensure the agreement remains fair and conscionable under the principle of the "veil of ignorance," the Landlord should be protected from sudden and unanticipated economic losses due to premature Tenant termination. It’s essential to adapt the agreement to integrate reasonable safeguards that maintain fairness for both parties under changing circumstances. 

Furthermore, it’s critical to create mechanisms within the lease to ensure that notice of termination is not merely a unilateral decision by the Tenant but one that considers the impact on both parties' rights and obligations. 

In response to these perspectives, retaining ethical integrity and fairness would suggest requiring a longer notice period or some form of lease termination penalty.
Edit: Modify Section 8.8 (Termination by Tenant) to state: "The Tenant may terminate this Lease without cause only after providing **two (2) years' written notice** to the Landlord and shall pay a termination fee equivalent to six months' Rent to mitigate the impact on the Landlord's financial stability."


Title: Market Rate Payment Post Original Term
Impact: The clause allows for Rent adjustment to be based on current market rates, risking unpredictability for future revenues.
Scenario: In a declining market, the transition to market pricing could result in significantly reduced rent income for the Landlord after the initial term.
Mitigation: Set a defined maximum percentage decrease in rent during the renewal period to safeguard the Landlord from drastic market fluctuations.

Arbitrator's POV:
 Analysis: The risk identified regarding Market Rate Payment Post Original Term has significant implications for both the Landlord and Tenant. From a legal perspective, if rent is adjusted based on fluctuating market rates, it can create uncertainties that could lead to potential disputes about 'fair market value'. For the Tenant, a significant increase could lead to financial strain, while for the Landlord, particularly in a declining market, the prospect of drastic income reductions poses a risk to operating expenses and profit margins. The fairness and ethical integrity of the agreement could thus be compromised if the terms do not provide a balanced approach to rent adjustments, particularly taking into consideration the tenants' abilities to absorb price increases without jeopardizing their businesses. Such disparities can create power imbalances, especially if one party has more financial literacy or bargaining power in negotiations. Therefore, the lease must include explicit mechanisms to protect both parties from extreme deviations in market conditions to sustain a conscionable agreement over time, considering John Rawls' principle of the 'veil of ignorance.'
Edit: In Section 3.0 **TERM**, insert a new clause stating: "Any adjustments to the Rent during the renewal period shall not result in a decrease of more than 10% from the last year's rental payment."


Title: Liability Limitations
Impact: Limiting Landlord's liability only to negligence may not sufficiently protect against all types of claims arising from the Tenant's operations.
Scenario: The Tenant's negligence could result in lawsuits that affect the Landlord indirectly, posing risks to its reputation.
Mitigation: Introduce clear clauses that specify Landlord’s liability in cases of indirect losses caused by Tenant's operations.

Arbitrator's POV:
 Analysis: The potential risk surrounding the limitations on the Landlord's liability to only instances of negligence creates an imbalance that disadvantages the Landlord. This one-sided clause fails to account for situations where tenant actions (even those deemed inadvertent) could lead to significant reputational damage, financial loss, or liability claims against the Landlord by third parties. If the Tenant's negligence results in lawsuits that tarnish the Landlord's reputation, the limitation of liability may thus contribute to an inequitable position for the Landlord, undermining the fairness and ethical foundations of the agreement. The Tenant may be unaware of how their actions could indirectly affect the Landlord, resulting in an unconscionable agreement over time, particularly when power dynamics shift (e.g., economic downturns causing increased scrutiny of financial stability of parties).
Edit: Amend Section 10.10 to include language stating, 'The Landlord will not be held liable for any claims, damages or losses arising from the Tenant's operations, except in cases of direct negligence; the Tenant agrees to indemnify the Landlord for all indirect losses, including reputational damage, costs, and claims that result from the Tenant's actions or inactions.'


Title: Environmental Compliance Risk
Impact: Vague definitions around liability for environmental compliance may expose the Landlord without clearly defining responsibilities.
Scenario: If the Tenant fails to comply with environmental laws resulting in fines, the Landlord could be inadvertently held liable, affecting reputation and finances.
Mitigation: Explicitly assign responsibility for environmental compliance solely to the Tenant, and require them to maintain environmental insurance.

Arbitrator's POV:
 Analysis: The commercial lease agreement faces potential risks due to power imbalances stemming from financial disparities, legal knowledge gaps, and possible ambiguities in compliance with environmental laws. From a legal perspective, if the Tenant is less informed about environmental regulations or its implications, this could place the Landlord in a precarious situation where they may be held liable for the Tenant's non-compliance with such laws. Financially, if the Tenant is unable to fulfill their responsibilities (e.g., paying fines for violations), the Landlord could face indirect financial repercussions, such as increased insurance premiums or damage to their reputation.

Furthermore, without clear documentation regarding the responsibilities for maintaining compliance with Environmental Laws, ambiguity could lead to disputes later on. Over time, these factors create an environment that may be perceived as unconscionable, especially if the Tenant feels pressured or unable to negotiate more favorable terms, leading to an ethically questionable agreement that lacks transparency and fairness. 

From an adaptive solutions perspective, it is essential to incorporate provisions that allow for periodic reviews of the lease terms to ensure they remain fair and mutually agreeable under evolving circumstances. This includes creating mechanisms for renegotiating terms in response to significant changes in laws or market conditions, thereby promoting flexibility and addressing any legal loopholes or ambiguities that may arise.
Edit: Add a clause stating: "The Tenant shall be solely responsible for compliance with all Environmental Laws, and shall obtain and maintain environmental insurance to cover any potential liabilities arising from such compliance, providing evidence of said insurance to the Landlord annually."


Title: Insurance Requirements Left Undetermined
Impact: Lack of specific insurance requirements may leave the Landlord inadequately protected in the event of Tenant-related issues.
Scenario: Should a liability claim arise, the Landlord might find insufficient coverage, leading to financial loss.
Mitigation: Clearly define minimum insurance policies the Tenant must maintain, including liability, property, and environmental coverage.

Arbitrator's POV:
 Analysis: The current commercial lease agreement illustrates features that might contribute to power imbalances, particularly in clauses pertaining to financial liabilities and responsibilities. The financial agreement, which dictates that the Tenant pays 50% of the gross revenue, may favor the Landlord if the Tenant lacks adequate financial resources or knowledge regarding their legal obligations. Additionally, the clear absence of insurance requirements leaves the Landlord vulnerable to risks associated with potential liabilities arising from the Tenant's operations.

From a legal perspective, both parties should seek to uphold the principles of fairness and conscionability. There is concern that the Tenant may not fully understand their obligations, particularly regarding compliance with Environmental Laws and maintaining the Premises, which could exploit their relative inexperience.

In terms of adaptive solutions, such as rent reviews and insurance requirements, the agreement should include provisions that could address unexpected economic downturns or natural events—situations that could affect the Tenant's ability to pay rent or maintain operations. 

The risks present in the lease—such as the inadequate specification of insurance coverage and undefined terms regarding the Rent review process—could foster potential disputes or financial disadvantage to one of the parties, especially if a significant adverse event occurs. Adopting measures like mandatory mediation before litigation for disputes arising from breaches can alleviate the concerns of power imbalance by ensuring both parties engage on equitable terms.
Edit: Add a clause that stipulates: 'The Tenant shall maintain at their expense minimum insurance coverage including general liability, property damage, and any necessary environmental liability insurance, with policy limits not less than [SPECIFY AMOUNTS] and naming the Landlord as an additional insured party, with proof of such insurance provided annually.'


Title: Financial Risk from Revenue Sharing
Impact: The Tenant's rent is based on 50% of the gross revenue derived from the operation, which exposes the Tenant to significant financial risk in case of fluctuating business performance or economic downturns.
Scenario: If the laundry facilities face a sudden decline in customer demand due to a local economic downturn or increased competition, revenue will decrease, resulting in reduced rent income for the Landlord but increased financial strain on the Tenant.
Mitigation: Revising clause 5.1 to set a minimum rent amount that provides the Tenant with a predictable base expense could decrease financial unpredictability while still allowing the Landlord to benefit from increased revenues during profitable periods.

Arbitrator's POV:
 Analysis: From a **Legal & Financial** perspective, the agreement's reliance on a revenue-sharing model (50% of gross revenue) could lead to an unbalanced situation for the Tenant, especially during downturns. A lack of minimum rent guarantees puts the Tenant at significant risk, potentially leading to financial distress without corresponding rent relief for the Landlord, thereby creating an inequitable power dynamic over time. If the Tenant has less financial knowledge or access to legal counsel than the Landlord, they may not fully grasp the implications of such an agreement, leading to potential exploitation. Legal knowledge gaps can hinder the Tenant's ability to negotiate better terms that reflect their financial capabilities and business realities. 

For **Adaptive Solutions**, incorporating clauses that allow the lease to adapt to varying economic conditions can better serve both parties. A minimum rent clause provides a safety net for the Tenant, ensuring they can manage their costs during lean times while still facilitating the Landlord's interest in a higher share during profitable periods. This helps maintain the conscionability of the agreement as circumstances change. Additionally, regular reviews of the lease terms to reflect current market conditions or economic trends could also promote fairness and adaptability.

To mitigate the identified risk of financial strain from a revenue-sharing model, the following edit is suggested:

**Edit**: "The Rent for the Tenant shall be the greater of **$[MINIMUM AMOUNT]** per annum or **50% of the gross revenue** derived from the operation, ensuring that the Tenant has a predictable baseline of rental expense."

This proposed revision allows the Tenant to have a minimum financial obligation, thus softening the blow of unforeseen revenue drops without unfairly penalizing the Landlord during prosperous times. If the minimum rent were not in place, a sharp decline in revenue could push the Tenant towards default, resulting in significant financial hardship or even business closure, ultimately impacting both parties negatively.
Edit: "The Rent for the Tenant shall be the greater of **$[MINIMUM AMOUNT]** per annum or **50% of the gross revenue** derived from the operation, ensuring that the Tenant has a predictable baseline of rental expense."


Title: Ambiguity in Rent Review Mechanism
Impact: Vagueness in rent review provisions may lead to disputes about the market rate for renewal periods, potentially increasing costs for the Tenant beyond reasonable expectations.
Scenario: Disputes over what constitutes 'current market rates' can lead to prolonged negotiations or legal battles, increasing costs for both parties and risking operational continuity for the Tenant.
Mitigation: The agreement should specify a clear formula or a predetermined method for rent reviews to create transparency and reduce future conflicts.

Arbitrator's POV:
 Analysis: The ambiguity in the rent review mechanism presents a significant legal and financial risk as it can result in power imbalances between the Landlord and Tenant. If the current wording lacks specificity regarding the criteria for determining 'market rates', it opens the door to subjective interpretation. The Landlord, having more experience or knowledge in real estate dealings, may exploit this ambiguity to propose higher rates than what is fair or typical in the market, potentially placing the Tenant in a precarious financial situation. This unequal power dynamic threatens the conscionability of the lease, as it may create an environment where the Tenant feels pressured to accept unfavorable terms to avoid disputes, thereby compromising the ethical integrity of the agreement.

Potential legal challenges could arise if disputes escalate over what constitutes 'market rates', leading either party to seek judicial intervention. This could further complicate the relationship and incur costs for both parties due to legal fees and potential delays in operations, affecting the overall financial viability of the Tenant's business.
Edit: Amend Section 5.2 to state: "Rent Review shall occur biannually based on an agreed-upon formula using the average rent rates for commercial laundry facilities within a 10-mile radius, reflecting changes over the previous 12 months, to ensure transparency and fairness in determining market rates."


Title: Legal Liability and Indemnification Limitations
Impact: Clause 6.10 limits the Landlord's liability which could disproportionately shift risks to the Tenant, especially in cases of negligence or property damage.
Scenario: In a situation where the Tenant suffers losses due to the Landlord's negligence, the Tenant may have limited recourse to recover costs, impacting operational viability.
Mitigation: Negotiating a modified indemnification clause that provides the Tenant with clearer rights for recourse against the Landlord in situations of negligence or breach of duty could help balance liability.

Arbitrator's POV:
 Analysis: From a legal and financial standpoint, the disparity in negotiating power between the Landlord and the Tenant may not only stem from financial aspects but also from unequal access to legal counsel and understanding of the lease terms. The Tenant's obligations in indemnifying the Landlord (as outlined in Clause 6.9) could result in significant liability without sufficient protection against the Landlord's own negligence. This creates a potential for an unconscionable agreement whereby the Tenant, possibly lacking the legal acumen, may unknowingly assume excessive liability for scenarios largely out of their control, such as damages arising from inherent property defects or the Landlord’s negligence. Furthermore, the Tenant's ongoing financial obligations to maintain the premises, while the Landlord's repairs are only activated upon tenant default (Clause 8.1), could further imbalance responsibilities. 

Given the possibility of changing market conditions and unforeseen events such as natural disasters, including a provision for a force majeure or an escalation clause could help protect both parties while promoting fairness. 

By incorporating clearer language regarding liability limitations and providing clearer recourse in instances where the Landlord is responsible for damages, the agreement can address potential future imbalances and maintain its conscionability in the long term. Additionally, ensuring both parties have access to legal resources at the beginning of the lease term would also support transparency and understanding.
Edit: Amend Clause 6.10 to include, 'The liability and indemnity contained in this Section shall not apply in cases of the Landlord’s negligence, and the Landlord shall be liable for any direct damages resulting from its negligence or breach of contract.'


Title: Lack of Clarity in Termination Rights
Impact: The Tenant can terminate without cause, which provides flexibility but can lead to uncertainty in the Tenant's operational environment, affecting long-term business planning.
Scenario: If the Landlord exercises their rights arbitrarily, it may disrupt the Tenant's operations and cause financial instability due to unexpected relocation or operational pauses.
Mitigation: Setting specific conditions under which termination without cause can occur, along with an extended notice period, could provide stability and security for the Tenant's business operations.

Arbitrator's POV:
 Analysis: In assessing the fairness and conscionability of a commercial lease agreement, particularly regarding the Tenant's termination rights, it's critical to examine the potential for power imbalances stemming from differing financial knowledge, legal resources, and the impact of economic fluctuations on both parties. The current provision allowing the Tenant to terminate the lease without cause offers operational flexibility but inherently creates risks of financial instability for the Landlord while increasing uncertainty for the Tenant regarding long-term location security. From a legal and financial perspective, the disparity between parties’ understanding of lease intricacies may lead to unfair exploitation, particularly if one party has access to more sophisticated legal counsel or financial advisors. Conversely, the potential for arbitrary termination could foster an environment of unpredictability that hinders the Tenant’s ability to plan strategically for the future while weighing location decisions and capital investments. This could ultimately affect the values and negotiations conducted both now and at renewal stages, realizing an imbalance that undermines the ethical integrity of the agreement.

To maintain fairness and flexibility while adapting to future changes, it is essential to include provisions addressing termination that reflect current market standards and provide both parties with a clear framework that mitigates risks associated with sudden changes.
Edit: Amend Section 8.8 to read: "The Tenant may terminate this Lease without cause on two (2) years’ written notice to the Landlord, provided that during this notice period the Tenant shall maintain rental payments and the Premises in accordance with the terms outlined in this Lease, ensuring stability for the Landlord and predictability for the Tenant's operational plans."


Title: Potential for Excessive Costs for Tax and Utility Payments
Impact: The Tenant is responsible for all Taxes and Utility Costs without limits, which can lead to unanticipated financial burdens and disputes with the Landlord over charge allocations.
Scenario: Unexpected increases in property taxes or utility costs could significantly increase the Tenant's operational costs, affecting profitability if not anticipated.
Mitigation: Inserting a cap on the escalation of taxes and utility costs or specifying how utility costs will be calculated could help the Tenant budget effectively and mitigate unexpected liabilities.

Arbitrator's POV:
 Analysis: The current lease agreement places an extensive financial burden on the Tenant by holding them fully responsible for all Taxes and Utility Costs without a defined limit. This creates a power imbalance that may render the agreement unconscionable if these costs increase disproportionately over time. Additionally, without clear guidelines on how these costs are calculated or allocated, the Tenant is placed at risk of unexpected financial liabilities, particularly in situations involving sudden hikes in municipal taxes or utility rates. This potential for excessive costs can hamper the Tenant's profitability and operational viability, particularly if they lack access to legal advice or have limited financial literacy compared to the Landlord, thereby compromising the agreement's fairness and ethical integrity. The absence of safeguards in negotiating the responsibilities regarding these costs could expose the Tenant to exploitation, especially in times of economic downturn or unexpected natural events affecting costs.
Edit: Insert a clause that states: "The total annual increase in Taxes and Utility Costs payable by the Tenant shall not exceed 5% of the previous year's total charges, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing, to provide the Tenant with predictable budgeting costs and mitigate the risk of excessive financial burdens.", to clearly define and limit the Tenant's financial exposure to unforeseen escalations.
