['The appeal involves 4350 NW 8 Terrace, LLC (Landlord) and Commercial Laundries, Inc. (Tenant), addressing disputes over a long-term commercial lease.', 'The underlying lease agreement was executed in October 1998, providing rental space for a laundry machine business with an initial ten-year term.', 'The rental payment is structured as "50% of the gross revenue derived from the operation of said equipment."', 'The lease allows the Tenant to extend the initial ten-year lease for two successive seven-year terms unless the Tenant notifies the Landlord at least six months prior to the end of the original lease term.', 'An addendum to the lease executed around the same time offers an option to extend the lease for an additional ten years in exchange for a payment of "the then current market rate for similar laundry room leases."', 'The Landlord contends the Tenant never paid the current market rate required by the addendum and instead automatically extended the lease for two additional seven-year terms as outlined in Paragraph Eight.', 'The Tenant argues that the extension in the addendum was a condition precedent and claims the lease automatically extends to at least 2025.', 'The Tenant asserts it has made a total payment of $100,000 for leasehold improvements, although the precise nature and acceptance of this payment in relation to the lease extension is disputed.', "The Landlord filed seven identical lawsuits seeking eviction due to the Tenant's holdover status, asserting the lease expired on November 1, 2022.", 'The trial court ruled in favor of the Tenant, finding the conditions for the ten-year extension in the addendum were satisfied, a finding the Landlord disputed on appeal.', "The appellate court reversed the trial court's decision, determining that the conditions for the ten-year lease extension provided by the addendum were not met, noting that no evidence was presented that the Tenant sought to exercise this option before the expiration of the initial term."]
