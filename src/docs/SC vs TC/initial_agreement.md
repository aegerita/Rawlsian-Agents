## Pre-Nuptial Agreement

for use in England and Wales

This DEED is made on: _________________________

### 1. PARTIES

A. Mr TC, aged 58, currently residing in north London, England  
(hereafter the "First Party" or “Husband”)

B. SC, aged 50, currently residing in north London, England  
(hereafter the "Second Party" or “Wife”)

This DEED provides:

### 2. BACKGROUND

A. This Agreement is made in contemplation of and is conditional upon the intended marriage of the First Party and the Second Party on ______________________ (the "Marriage").

B. The First Party and the Second Party wish to enter into a binding agreement, recording their wishes and intentions regarding their finances and property in the event their Marriage breaks down and in the event of proceedings in the courts of England, Wales, or any other jurisdiction for the dissolution or annulment of the Marriage or for a decree of judicial separation or financial support of any kind or in relation to any of their property or assets.

C. Both Parties acknowledge:

i) The Husband, Mr TC, ceased employment in June 2020 due to an increasingly debilitating neurological condition, Parkinson’s Disease, formally diagnosed in 2011 but affecting him since approximately 2003/2004.

ii) The Wife, SC, has primarily been a homemaker in recent years, having previously pursued university education to Masters level and having worked with non-governmental organizations.

iii) In 1998, the Parties jointly purchased their family home (referred to herein as "Property X"), located in north London, and have owned the property for more than 20 years.

iv) During their marriage, the Parties acquired multiple valuable residential and investment properties, largely titled jointly and managed jointly. These properties were principally funded by the Husband’s substantial earnings during their marriage.

D. At the time of signing the previous marital agreement in 2014, the Parties had total net assets valued at approximately "£5,824,000".

E. The Parties acknowledge and explicitly reference their previously made marital agreement of 2014, in which the Husband voluntarily agreed to terms significantly favourable to the Wife, such that he would receive only about "£1,177,000 (around 20% of total assets)", significantly less than an equal division would have produced had the matter gone to court at that stage.

F. The Husband's intentions, confirmed explicitly in writing to his solicitor in February 2014, were:  
"Given my Parkinsons it makes no sense for me to have any assets in the long term... In that case the best outcome for SC and MC would be for SC to own all assets as sole owner."  
He further explicitly stated that "my position is that SC should have the maximum possible share of the assets upon a breakdown of our marriage."

G. It is recorded that the Husband has indicated he would accept terms significantly favourable to the Wife without contestation, despite receiving competent, independent legal advice to the contrary.

H. Both Parties reconfirm their explicit understanding and agreement that in the event of a permanent breakdown of the marriage, their respective rights and obligations will be exclusively governed by this Agreement, irrespective of either Party’s age or health conditions, including any further deterioration of the Husband’s health. The Parties further agree that the terms of this Agreement will explicitly not be reviewed or varied, even with substantial changes in circumstances.

I. Both Parties affirm having received independent legal advice prior to executing this Agreement and are fully aware of the rights and responsibilities they may be acquiring or surrendering as a consequence of entering into this Agreement, and enter into this Agreement of their own free will.

J. The following child is the child of both Mr TC and SC:  
MC, currently aged 17 (nearly 18), presently enrolled at a private boarding school.

K. Both Parties are domiciled and habitually resident in England and Wales and intend this Agreement to bind their heirs, receivers, trustees, and personal representatives.

### 3. DATE OF EFFECT

This Agreement shall come into effect upon the Parties celebrating a valid ceremony of Marriage on _____________________ or at any other later date, provided that if the Marriage is not celebrated within 12 months of the date of this Agreement, it shall be deemed discharged unless revived by supplemental agreement signed by both Parties.

### 4. ASSETS

A. The Parties explicitly confirm their marital home is “Property X”, located in north London and jointly owned by the Parties.

B. All assets titled individually by either Party prior to the Marriage shall remain in their respective absolute beneficial ownership throughout the Marriage and upon any subsequent dissolution unless otherwise expressly stipulated.

C. Neither Party shall make a claim against individually titled assets of the other, whether acquired before or after the marriage, nor pursue claims arising from their marriage unless expressly stipulated herein.

D. Both Parties explicitly agree that all joint real property acquired during the marriage and currently held jointly—including specifically the family home Property X and all additional investment properties and residential assets jointly acquired—shall become the sole absolute property of the Wife (SC) following any dissolution of marriage, consistent with the explicit intentions and voluntary offers made by the Husband.

E. Both Parties explicitly acknowledge that the Husband has voluntarily offered additional assets—specifically Property Z and all investment properties—to the Wife, notwithstanding that these additional assets were not actively sought by the Wife at the time of this Agreement.

### 5. PROVISION ON DISSOLUTION

A. The Parties explicitly agree that upon dissolution, annulment, or permanent separation of longer than six months:

i) All individually owned property shall remain the respective property of the individual owner;

ii) All joint property, specifically including but not limited to Property X, Property Z, and all additional investment properties acquired or owned jointly during the marriage, shall become the absolute sole beneficial ownership of the Wife (SC), without any claim or subsequent contestation by the Husband.

iii) Neither Party shall have any further financial claims upon the other following dissolution, nor make any claims upon the estate of the other.

B. Both Parties explicitly acknowledge this Agreement represents their free, comprehensive, and final agreement regarding financial matters, irrespective of age, health condition, or change in circumstances, intended explicitly not to be subject to any subsequent review or variation.

### 6. PROVISION ON DEATH

A. In the event of the death of either Party, the provisions herein relating to assets shall remain binding and enforceable to the extent permissible by law.

B. Personal chattels shall be distributed in accordance with will provisions executed individually and in conformity with this Agreement. 

### 7. EXECUTION OF WILLS

The Parties agree to execute wills reflecting provisions consistent with clauses 5 and 6 herein and further explicitly agree not to pursue claims under the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975 or any similar legal statute.

### 8. VARIATION OR AMENDMENT

Notwithstanding any other clause of the template provided, both Parties explicitly record here their intention that this Agreement shall not be subject to review or amendment irrespective of any substantial changes in circumstances, including any further deterioration of the Husband’s health, consistent with their explicit intentions as recorded herein.

### 9. JURISDICTION

This Agreement shall be governed exclusively by English law and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.

### 10. PUBLICATION

Neither Party shall permit publication of this Agreement or related details in any public media.

### 11. SEVERABILITY OF CLAUSES

Any unenforceable clause shall be severed without affecting the validity and enforceability of remaining clauses.
